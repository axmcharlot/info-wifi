# info-wifi
This project is made to help someone who use debian family but don't know how to see information about their wifi like password or other.
To have this project in your own machine, I invite you to fork this project and then you can clone it and modify.
Once the cloning is complete, copy the wifi file to your command path like /bin or /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin make sure this file is executable
``` shell
cp wifi /usr/local/bin
```
Now the wifi commande is available and can launch anywere
